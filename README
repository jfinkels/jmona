jmona is a framework for creating evolutionary algorithms. It provides a basic,
generic API for building customized instances of genetic algorithms, genetic 
programming, and other evolutionary algorithms. See the examples in
"src/main/java/jmona/example/*", and the corresponding tests in
"src/test/java/jmona/example/*".

This software is released under the GPLv3; see COPYING for more information.

I release all original images in 
"src/test/resources/jmona/example/monalisa/images/" to the Public Domain.
