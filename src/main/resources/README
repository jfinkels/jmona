jmona is a framework for creating genetic algorithms. It provides a basic,
generic API for building customized genetic algorithms. See the examples in
"src/main/java/jmona.example.*", and the corresponding tests in
"src/test/java/jmona.example.*".

This software is released under the GPLv3; see COPYING for more information.

I release all original images in
