 * Among other classes, this package provides:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link jmona.impl.AbstractEvolutionContext}, a base class for
 * {@link jmona.EvolutionContext} implementations</li>
 * <li>{@link jmona.impl.DefaultCompletionCriteria}, a default
 * {@link jmona.CompletionCondition} implementation which checks for maximum
 * fitness and for maximum number of generations</li>
 * <li>{@link jmona.impl.DefaultPopulation}, a <code>Vector</code>-based default
 * implementation of a {@link jmona.Population}</li>
 * <li>{@link jmona.impl.PeriodicPostProcessor}, a base class for
 * {@link jmona.PostProcessor} implementations which execute periodically.</li>
