/**
 * Provides a default implementation of genetic algorithms interface with some
 * common necessary functionality.
 * 
 * The most important class is the {@link jmona.ga.impl.GAEvolutionContext},
 * which provides the context in which a genetic algorithm can run.
 * 
 * This package also provides a {@link jmona.ga.impl.BitFactory}, for use in
 * creating a sequence of bits (represented as Byte objects), which can be used
 * in a genetic algorithm in the more traditional way.
